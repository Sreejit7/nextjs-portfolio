# Hey, it's Sreejit!
I started learning Next.js and built this portfolio website for myself using Next.js and TypeScript. The portfolio is live in my own [domain](https://www.sreejit.dev)!

**You can find most stuff about my work, likings, skills, projects and blog here.**
And of course, feel free to drop a mail! I'd love to get some feedbacks or opportunities.

PS: This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
